        <p class="text">An adventurous time is an exhilarating period filled with excitement, exploration, and memorable experiences. It is a time when we break away from routine, embrace new challenges, and immerse ourselves in thrilling activities that push our boundaries and create lasting memories.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="text2">Exploring new destinations is another hallmark of an adventurous time. Whether it's hiking through uncharted trails, backpacking across unfamiliar landscapes, or venturing into remote areas, we immerse ourselves in the beauty and awe-inspiring wonders of the world.

            <h2 class="desc">BIKING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">Biking, also known as cycling, is a popular recreational activity, a means of transportation, and a competitive sport enjoyed by millions of people worldwide. It involves riding bicycles, which are human-powered vehicles with two wheels propelled by pedaling.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="text2">One of the most common forms of cycling is road biking. Road cyclists ride on paved roads, often covering long distances and enjoying the scenic routes. Road bikes are designed for speed and efficiency, with lightweight frames, narrow tires, and multiple gears to tackle different terrains. Road biking is not only a great way to stay fit but also an opportunity to explore new areas and enjoy the freedom of the open road.</p>
        <div class="bg bg2">
            <h2 class="desc">PARA-GLIDING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">Paragliding is an exhilarating adventure sport that allows individuals to soar through the skies, experiencing the freedom of flight. It involves flying a lightweight, foot-launched glider that resembles a parachute. Paragliders use the natural elements of wind and thermals to stay aloft and navigate through the air.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="text2">Paragliding provides a unique opportunity to experience the world from a different perspective. Launching from elevated sites, such as hills or mountains, paragliders harness the wind to lift them into the air. Once airborne, they rely on their skills and knowledge of aerodynamics to control the glider and navigate through the currents.</p>
        <div class="bg bg3">
            <h2 class="desc">SURFING</h2>
        </div>
        <p class="text">Surfing is a thrilling water sport that has captivated people for decades. It involves riding the waves on a surfboard, harnessing the power of the ocean to experience an exhilarating and unique sensation. Surfers, both beginners and experts, are drawn to the beauty and challenge of this sport, seeking the perfect wave and the feeling of freedom it provides.</p>
        <br><br>
        <p class="text2">The heart of surfing lies in the connection between the surfer and the ocean. Surfers paddle out into the water, patiently waiting for the ideal wave to catch. When the moment arrives, they paddle vigorously, positioning themselves just right to match the speed and power of the approaching wave. Once caught, the surfer stands up on the board and rides the wave, using skill, balance, and timing to perform maneuvers and maintain control.</p>
